# M3V7 Alpha 1.0B - September 4th 2020 build

## M3V7 Alpha 1.0B

### About

This is the second release of the SNU 2D cloud drive module, a module for cloud (online) storage for SNU distributions. I don't know why this hasn't already been done,
To make this, I sampled 5 different cloud services, and made emulations of them.

In this release, I:

> * Added a missing PDF for Google Drive

> * Archived the release info for version 1

> * Deleted all unnecessary `IGNORE.md` files.

> * No other changes in this release

I am currently unsure what will be done in the next release.
