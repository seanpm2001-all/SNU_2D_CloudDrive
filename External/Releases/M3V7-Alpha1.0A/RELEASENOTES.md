# M3V7 Alpha 1.0A - September 4th 2020 build

## M3V7 Alpha 1.0A

### About

This is the first release of the SNU 2D cloud drive module, a module for cloud (online) storage for SNU distributions. I don't know why this hasn't already been done,
To make this, I sampled 5 different cloud services, and made emulations of them.

In this release, I:

> * Added modes for OneDrive, Google Drive, pCloud, MediaFire, and DropBox

> * Added a homepage (fixes issue #2)

> * Added a CSV data file for the services

> * Added the ProjectWiki

> * No other changes in this release

I will be deleting template `IGNORE.md` files in the next release.
